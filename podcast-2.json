A couple of weeks ago, I opened to the podcast with a discussion about the, it's all in your head idiom, which is a terrible one, but one that is less terrible and relevant to our conversation today is fake it till you make it. It's punchy. It rhymes kind of rolls off the tongue, but there's also some power to it. Not just the saying to the strategy. One of the places where fake it till you make it is pretty helpful is in our own sense of confidence. As entrepreneurs, we do a lot of new things as our companies grow. As we grow, we're often on the edge of what's comfortable, of what's well known. And depending on our level of tolerance for operating outside of our experience, we're often needing to grow our confidence to include moments when maybe we're not 100% sure of ourselves. So in today's podcast episode, I'm going to talk about strategies to make you seem more confident in that gap in the interim where your confidence is growing. These are really simple, basic strategies that frankly, I use all the time, but having some handy dandy tools can make it less anxiety provoking to be in experiences or doing tasks where our confidence might be a little bit weak. But we don't want to undermine our success by giving it sort of a half ass try. Today's episode also exists as a YouTube video, which is a great spot to leave comments, questions, you know, like, and subscribe, do all the things. I really like the interactive nature of YouTube. So don't leave me hanging. Even if you don't want to watch the video, you can just listen to the podcast and take a minute to give me some feedback and some ideas on what you're thinking over there at the YouTube. I know it's not really called the YouTube that was said for the cringing benefit of my teenagers. Thanks so much for listening. Welcome to the Zen Founder podcast. This is a place where we have conversations about mental health and entrepreneurship. We have a pretty broad conceptualization of what mental health means. Sometimes depression, anxiety, sometimes relationships or physical health. The goal here is to bring some calm into the crazy roller coaster of ups and downs that is life for many entrepreneurs. I'm your host. I'm Dr. Sheri Walling. I'm a clinical psychologist and an entrepreneur married to an entrepreneur, live in the world of entrepreneurs. And I'm so pleased that you have joined us for this conversation. One of the trademark challenges of the life of an entrepreneur is that you are often challenged to do things that are just as subtle as the life of an entrepreneur, to do things that are just outside of your comfort zone. If you are growing business, if you are growing a self, you are always on the edge of growth, learning new things, trying new things, pitching new products, just doing things that are right on the edge of where you feel totally confident. And so part of the life of an entrepreneur is figuring out how to really come across as confident. Even if you're in that growth space where you might not feel 100% sure of what you're saying, of what you're doing. So how do you come across as just a little more confident than you might feel inside? I've got six confidence boosting strategies for you. The first three ways to appear more confident than maybe you actually feel have very much to do with your body, with how you hold yourself, how you show up in the physical space, even if it's a zoom call, the ways that people read us, that they interpret our confidence, they interpret how we're showing up have very much to do with how they feel and perceive and what they take in in their sensory experience of who we are and how we're presenting. So first thing to think about when you are wanting to appear really confident, number one is to manage your breath. If you can slow your breath down and really bring it down into the lower belly of your body, then not only are you appearing to be more confident, but you actually feel better. You feel less anxious. You feel less rattled. The thing that is really important to remember in this conversation about confidence is that emotion is contagious, just like a virus, I guess. Emotion is completely contagious. And so if you can manage your physiology, if you can manage your breath, if you can manage your calm, you are going to communicate that to whoever you're interacting with. So first step, breathe, breathe deeply, breathe slowly, really regulate your body and that in and of itself helps you to come across as someone who is calm and collected and really at home in their own skin. Second physical tactic or tip to appear more confident is to really stand up straight. Take up space in the room, even in the Zoom box. You want to make sure that your shoulders are open, that your heart is sort of facing whoever it is that you're speaking to. It appears that you are really again at home in the space that you take up and that you're not afraid to occupy the room, to occupy the conversation. You don't want to appear as if you are hiding. So when you're hunched over or just sort of sloppy, it communicates the sense that maybe you're not fully comfortable with yourself or you're not fully behind the message that you're bringing. So stand up straight, take up space. Third tactic that has to do also with our bodies is to really think about our faces. We want to use eye contact. We want to smile. The sense of being relaxed in our face and having this sort of friendly, neutral tone is really important. But eye contact also communicates this level of like, I see you, you see me, we see each other, and I'm not afraid to meet you eye to eye. So prolonged eye contact, certainly in the animal kingdom, is a sign of aggression. So you don't want to like stare someone down, but the ability to confidently and comfortably hold someone's eye contact with a little smile or a big smile, as the case may be, is a way of communicating with your face that you are present. You see them and that you are really able to take whatever they might have for you, that you are confidently and comfortably engaged in the conversation. The second three tactics have a little bit more to do with what's going on in here between your ears. The first is that when you're going into a situation where confidence is really important, preparation is going to be helpful. If you're going into a big conference room, for example, where there's lots of people milling around and it's more of a social hour, you want to be thoughtful about who you want to speak to, who you want to approach, maybe what questions you want to ask or what your talking points are, the things that are most relevant or most important to the situation that you want to make sure you drop into the conversation. This doesn't mean that you script everything. It doesn't mean that you anxiously plan out every word, but it does mean that a little preparation goes a long way, especially in those lulls, that dead space, the silence that can be super uncomfortable and can be the place where our confidence breaks down, where we're like, oh, I don't know what to say. So having a few things in your back pocket that you might bring up, having a few confidence boosting conversation topics is absolutely helpful for you coming across in a really confident and calm, comfortable way. The next psychological strategy that I find to be really helpful when it comes to confidence is to really cultivate an air of curiosity. When we are worried about our own confidence, we're in our own heads. We're thinking about ourselves. How am I coming across? Did that land well? Did I communicate? Did I see that in the best way? And when we get into that mode, when we're so internally focused and just thinking about ourselves, frankly, we really miss coming across to the audience or the people that we're interacting with in a way that communicates our interest in them. So when you are wanting to appear more confident, it's actually the most important thing is kind of like, don't worry about yourself and really cultivate curiosity. Think of some good questions to ask. Be really mindful of who it is that you're communicating with and how you can communicate to them that you're really interested in what they have to say in what they're thinking. So curiosity is a nice foundation for all confident communication because again, it takes us out of the hamster wheel in our mind of self-doubt and just allows us to be very present and focused on the person that we're interacting with. The last tactic that I have to offer might feel like a little bit woo, but I promise there's a lot of science behind this. And that's the idea that you have a mantra or a statement that you hold in your mind in this situation, or you're wanting to appear more confident. And it can be something very simple, like I'm okay. Or maybe it's something like I am love or I got this, but some kind of self-affirming, very simple mantra that you can return to in your brain when you start to get a little bit wiggy in your head, when you start to maybe circle or spiral a little bit. Some simple sort of foundational assumption that you want to be true. Maybe it's not always easy to believe that it's true, but something that you could really return to that you feel really comfortable with. I'm okay. I got this. This is important. I have everything I need inside of me to rise to this occasion. Something simple, write it down, put it in your pocket, or just practice rehearsing it in your brain. And it's something that you can help use to calm yourself, to focus yourself, to center yourself when you want to appear and to be truly from your toes to the top of your head, more confident. In my work as a clinical psychologist for entrepreneurs and high performers, it is my deep delight to help people work through some of these barriers. The things that you have inside of you, inside of your heart, inside of your mind, the creative strategies, ideas that you have for how to solve meaningful problems, how to create businesses that are sustainable and successful. We got to do the inner work in order to be able to do the outer work. So let me let my team know if we can be of service to you. You can find us at zenfounder.com. We also have a podcast.
